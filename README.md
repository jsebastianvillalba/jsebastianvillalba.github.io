I have 4 years of experience in Product Management in the construction and industrial sectors. I help companies to develop product strategies and business through Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence.

I am specializing in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Winnipeg, PACE. During this program, I have developed Data Analytics projects for Business Intelligence and Customer Analytics; and an 83% precision Machine Learning algorithm in Google Cloud Platforms for predicting the blood pressure of a person given their lifestyle metrics. 

2023 is the year of Artificial Intelligence. I am a believer that through ethics and responsible development, AI will help humanity overcome challenges such as inequality, climate change, and agroindustrial production. I am passionate about reading AI papers and news and writing essays reflecting on how it is shaping our future. I have written two articles about AI: "Artificial Intelligence and the Future of the Canadian Workplace" and "AI Diversity and Inclusion". In these articles, I explore through statistics and humanities the fears of workers of being replaced by machines, and why is a must to be inclusive in AI development teams. 

During my work experience, I have had the opportunity of being a change leader. The development of new products and businesses brings change to interdisciplinary organizations, and workers who are reluctant to change need help and motivation. For them, I have created and provided educational product training through YouTube videos, conferences, online meetings, and personalized training sessions

# [Exploratory Data Analysis - IOWA LIQUOR STORE](https://github.com/jsebastianvillalba/EDA/blob/main/EDA_project_JoseSebastian_Villalba.ipynb)

Through this Jupyter Notebook file, I use some basic data exploration techniques to perform EDA over the Iowa Liquor Store public dataset. The aim of this project is to clean, normalize, and analyze the database and the relationship between features to understand how to use this data to further ML developments. In this project, I have also performed some Hypothesis Testing over some hypothetical assumptions.

One of the coolest things that I learned by developing this project was to plot using Pyplotlib boxplot visualizations for categorical-quantitative relationships and scatter plots for quantitative feature relationships.

# [SIMULATIONS - Elevator Traffic Analysis using Numpy Arrays](https://github.com/jsebastianvillalba/jsebastianvillalba.github.io/blob/main/Elevator_Traffic_Simulation_.ipynb)

In this project, I have developed an elevator Montecarlo traffic simulation to calculate the average waiting time for an elevator in an office building using the probability distributions of population per floor and chances of having a determinate number of passengers in an elevator. The algorithm iterates ten thousand times to cover a wide range of possibilities and then calculates the estimated "Round Trip Time" of the elevator in seconds:

This simulation expands the simple Elevator Traffic Analysis based on a probability theoretical study as it not only shows the expected mean but also the probability distribution.
